# pat-s-enigma
the implementation of enigma. 
it gots 3 rotor now, but may be added more. 
the original message was some dialogues. 
this only work with ENGLISH. 
why not find a way to decipher it? 
better not to peek at the result of translator :)

How to use this:
Run 'enigma.py' for creating encrypted massage, you don't need this if you just want to do the decipheration
'enigma_translator.py' read the password table form 'roter1.txt' 'roter2.txt' 'roter3.txt' and could translate the encried message, but you need to work out these txt files, in which contance the state of roter, first.
'encry_message.txt' is a encryed message, the original message are some dialogues

HAVE FUN :)
