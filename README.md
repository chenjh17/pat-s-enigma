# pat-s-enigma
the implementation of enigma. 
it gots 3 rotor now, but may be added more. 
the original message was some dialogues. 
this only work with ENGLISH. 
why not find a way to decipher it? 
better not to peek at the result of translator :)

How to use this:
Run 'enigma.py' for creating encrypted massage, you don't need this if you just want to do the decipheration
'enigma_translator.py' read the password table form 'real_tran_table.txt', and taht is what to be decipher
'encry_message.txt' is a encryed message, the original message are some dialogues

HAVE FUN :)
